# The Mule Planner

work in progress!

Missing:
- Add CI/CD
- Add MUnits

Need to wait for future ACB release that:
- Lets you add Global Element Configurations using the UI
- Lets you create MUnits
- Lets you add DataWeave code from the Transform Message

Otherwise, Studio will have to be used to record.
